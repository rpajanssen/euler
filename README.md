Example project euler solutions

Project 19

https://projecteuler.net/problem=19

-> first solve it simple/brute force not using any libs (not even java time)
-> then refactor and improve

Example solutions:
- 1st solution : brute force with three nested loops
- 2nd solution : get rid of the loop over each day in the month
- 3rd solution : get rid of another loop to decrease cyclomatic complexity further
- 4th solution : cleaning up code, extracting methods
- 5th solution : extracting logic to classes, cleanup code and main algorithm

- last solution : using local-date
